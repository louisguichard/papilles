🍲 **About Papilles**

Papilles is a **visual cookbook** and **recipe gallery** designed for home chefs. It's a web application that transforms your cooking recipes into beautiful visual collections to inspire cooking and sharing. I originally developed this project to learn about **Django**, allowing me to explore:
- 🔐 Authentication and user management systems
- 🗃️ Relational database design with Django's ORM
- 📁 Media handling for uploading and serving recipe images
- 🎨 Dynamic template rendering for beautiful recipe displays
